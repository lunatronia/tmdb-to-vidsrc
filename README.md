## THIS PROJECT IS MADE SOLELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES (ew it's that phrase)

### what is this?
this is just a python script that makes api requests and combines strings and such. i used tmdb and vidsrc because their apis are very simple and very fast.
the only libraries used are built-in (as far as i know). i am very new to python, so any insight is highly appreciated.

### disclaimer

please do not use this app to pirate as it is wrong and unethical.
i also do not claim ownership of anything other than the code.
